# Unfurl

Unfurl takes a matrix (a two dimensional array) as input and returns a string. The matrix may be of arbitrary size and must consist of uppercase English letters.  The returned string will consist of all elements of the matrix ordered in a clockwise spiral pattern starting with element [0, 0].  Each letter will be converted to lowercase and separated by a single whitespace character.
                                                                               
For example, given the following matrix:

    A B C D
    E F G H
    I J K L
                                                                               
The resulting string would be:  "a b c d h l k j i e f g"
